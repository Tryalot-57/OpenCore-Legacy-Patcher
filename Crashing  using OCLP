I have been using OpenCore Patcher for several months but for the last few it has become non-functional.  Applications crash multiple times a session and make the computer a pain to run.  I did ask this question a while back and got a helpful response but I have forgotten what that advice was.  I think it was to turn off settings in the OCLP APP which did the trick.  Any help would be gratefully appreciated.
