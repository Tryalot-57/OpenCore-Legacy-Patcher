Having some success with OCLP on my three out of date computers. Can updaate to Monterey 12.7.2 on 2/3 but one comes up with error messageâ€¦
"support.apple.com/mac/startup with the closed wheel on top.
This also happens if I try to migrate from Monterey upwards in single OS steps on the other two computers.
Hardware in list of compatible items with OCLP.
Any clues about what is going wrong and how or if I could move forward.
My target is to end up with 3 x Ventura OS. Looked at Sonoma and can't stand the radical overhaul of OS for no obvious reason than changing for changes sake.
